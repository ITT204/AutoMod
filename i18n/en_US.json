    "log_val": "Logging allows you to keep track of what is happening in your server. Everything related to logging is configured using the ``{prefix}log`` command. The first command argument is always the option you want to configure, for example ``mod`` for mod logs. \n\nThe following are the available log options: \n>  ``mod`` → For (auto-)mod logs like bans etc. \n>  ``server`` → For server logs like channel & emoji events \n>  ``messages`` → For message deletion/edit logs \n>  ``joins`` → For member join/leave logs \n>  ``voice`` → For voice join/leave/switch events \n>  ``reports`` → For logging of reports via right-clicking on a message \n \nThe second command argument is either the channel you want the logs to be sent to, or ``True`` for the 'disable' parameter to disable the option. \n\nTwo examples would be: \n>  ``{prefix}log mod #mod-logs`` → Enables mod logging and sends them to #mod-logs \n>  ``{prefix}log mod disable:True`` → Disables mod logs",
    "automod_val": "You can configure rules, and how the bot should behave upon violation. This is done using the ``{prefix}automod`` command. The first command argument is always the rule you want to configure, for example ``invites``. \n\nAll available rules are: \n>  ``invites`` → Server invites \n>  ``links`` → Web links other than invites \n>  ``files`` → Uncommon file types \n>  ``mentions`` → Max allowed mentions\n>  ``lines`` → Max allowed line splits \n>  ``emotes`` → Max allowed emotes  \n>  ``repeat`` → Max allowed repetition of words  \n>  ``zalgo`` → Zalgo characters \n>  ``caps`` → Excessive CAPS usage \n\nThe second argument is either the warn amount users should receive or a threshold for the rule. Only ``mentions``, ``lines``, ``emotes`` & ``repeat`` require a threshold. Set the warn amount to 0 if you just want the message to be deleted. To disable a rule, use ``off`` as the second argument. \nExamples would be: \n>  ``{prefix}automod invites 1`` → Flags users with 1 warn for invites \n>  ``{prefix}automod repeat off`` → Disables the repeat rule",
    "pun_val": "You can easily set punishments for a specific amount of warns. This is configured using the ``{prefix}punishment`` command. The first command argument is always the warn amount the action should be enforced at. The second argument is the action itself. \n\nThese are all available actions: \n>  ``kick`` → Kicks the user \n>  ``ban`` → Bans the user (can be temporary) \n>  ``mute`` → Temporarily mutes the user \n>  ``none`` → Removes the configured action for the warn amount \n\nThe third argument is a duration for the action. The ``mute`` action has to have this given, while the ``ban`` action can take this if you want a user to be temp banned. Durations are formatted like ``2m`` for 2 minutes or ``1h`` for 1 hour. \n\nExamples would be: \n>  ``{prefix}punishment 1 kick`` → Will kick users upon reaching 1 warn \n>  ``{prefix}punishment 2 mute 10m`` → Will mute users upon reaching 2 warns \n>  ``{prefix}punishment 3 none`` → Will remove the action configured for 3 warns",
